# IndependentProject-SupplyChain

## Project Description

This DApps was design to simulate the trade between seller and buyer. First of all, the seller should create a product and publish it to the blockchain. After that, it will generate a contract. Give the contract generated to the potential buyer. After the buyer confirm want to buy the product, the buyer could complete the several steps of DApps, after that, do the payment and the trade was done.

## How To Run The Project

* To run this project, You can install the @reachsh/stdlib JavaScript library into your React project, or for convenience, instead of setting up a React project, you can simply use the command $ reach react. 
* This command runs your DApp with the React development server in a Docker container which has Reach and React JavaScript dependencies pre-installed, so it starts up much faster than building them yourself. 
* USE $ REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ALGO for your connector.
